there are three Django models: Category, Customer, and Product. Let's analyze the relationships between them:

Category Model:

This model represents a category for products.
There is no explicit relationship defined in this model.
Customer Model:

This model represents a customer.
There is no explicit relationship defined in this model.
Product Model:

This model represents a product.
It has a ForeignKey relationship with the Category model, indicating that each product belongs to a single category. This is a many-to-one (or one-to-many) relationship where one category can have multiple products but each product belongs to only one category.
